# Digi Test

A test I took for a job opportunity at Digi.

## Built with

- .NET Core (2.1.500)

## How to get it running

- Clone the repository
  `git clone https://github.com/gwyddie/digi-test`

- Change directory with
  `cd digi-test`

- Then, execute it
  `dotnet run`

## How it works

It's simply made with C# and, since it's a simple task, with no needless classes, just a few static methods and some LINQ.

That's all, folks!

Thanks :)
